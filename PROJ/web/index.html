                      <p>Open a terminal, command prompt, or bash. Change your directory into the "PROJ" directory where the program is located, and type in <code>./build/bin/flashphoto</code>. If the program did not start, type in <code>make flashphoto</code>, followed by <code>./build/bin/flashphoto</code>. While we recognize that this is not very user friendly and requires the user to be knowledgeable with using command line codes, we are working to make the program easier for users to understand and look for a new release soon.</p>

                                    This tool is designed to look like a calligraphy pen.  It works almost the same way as the Pen tool.  Like the Pen tool, it is completely opaque and it covers up any “paint” that was already applied to the canvas.  However, the difference with the Calligraphy Pen is applied tool is an oval tilted at a 30-degree angle.

                                       The motion blur filter is extremely similar to the blur filter, as the sharpness of the image is reduced. However, the motion blur filter 
                                        creates a direction of blur. Currently 4 directions are suppported by Flashphoto: North-South, East-West, Northwest-Southeast, and 
                                        Northeast-Southwest.

                                       The channels filter adjusts individual R,G,B channel saturation values. Saturation values of 1 keep the channel the same color,
                                        values above 1 increase the vibrancy of the channel, and values below 1 decrease the vibrancy.

                      <p>For those who like to view images and mark directly onto the image, MIA can be used with a popup display window. For those who need to process and image without displaying an image, an easy to use command line mode is supported.</p>
                      <h5>Display Mode</h5>
                      <p>Open a terminal, command prompt, or bash. Change your directory into the "PROJ" directory where the program is located, and type in <code>./build/bin/mia</code>. If the program did not start, type in <code>make mia</code>, followed by <code>./build/bin/mia</code>. While we recognize that this is not very user friendly and requires the user to be knowledgeable with using command line codes,we are working to make the program easier for users to understand and look for a new release soon.</p>
                      <br>
                      <h5>Command Line Mode</h5>
                      <p>Open a terminal, command prompt, or bash. Change your directory into the "PROJ" directory where the program is located, and type in <code>./build/bin/mia</code>. Following this command, enter in the desired input file as a PNG image. Additionally, add the desired filters after the input image, and when all desired commands have been added, include an output file for the finished image to be saved to.</p>
                      <p>The command line should look like this once commands and input files have been added:</p>
                      <code>./build/bin/mia input.png command1 value1 command2 value2 ... output.png</code>
                      <p>The usage of the command line commands and usage is:</p>

                                      This tool is designed to look like a pen.  It makes an opaque, circular mark with constant intensity.  This means that when the pen is applied to the canvas the digital ink from the pen completely covers any color that had previously been applied to the canvas at that position.

                  The Flashphoto and MIA directories are set up as follows:
                  <pre>
                  src/
                      external/
                      flashphoto/
                      imagetools/
                      mia/
                      tests/
                  </pre>
                  <p>The external directory is where the google testing gtest framework is compiled, as well as where the graphics framework is stored. The flashphoto and mia directories store the location of the flashphoto and mia application, which both utilize the external directory's graphics framework. The tests directory stores all gtests for the flashphoto and mia application, as well as the imagetools directory files.</p>
                  <p>The imagetools directory is where all of the tools, filters, and commands are located. During compilation of the Flashphoto and MIA applications, the imagetools directory is compiled into a library, which is then linked to the two applications. Additionally, the library is linked to the tests directory for testing.</p>
                  <p>The Model View Controller Paradigm was used in the design of the MIA and Flashphoto applications. The reason for using the paradigm is to partition the application such that it can be scaled, easily maintained, and allow for possible changes to be as localized to the area of the change as possible. For example, the tools and filters are implemented separately from both MIA and Flashphoto. If a problem occurred while using a tool, the source can be tracked down quicker and more efficiently to the corresponding file. Additionally, if either MIA or Flashphoto require a tool or filter to be added or removed from the application, it is much easier to do as it would simply require the feature to be updated with the GUI for the application. Another major reason for using the MVC is code reusability. Once a feature has been added to the imagetools library, any application utilizing the library can implement the new feature provided it is properly setup with the GUI.</p>
                  <p>There are 3 major classes within the application: Tools, Filters, and ImageEditorCommands. All are located within the imagetools directory. The major classes are described in the following subsections</p>
                  <div class="subsection" title="ToolsDesign">
                      <h5 align="center">Tools Design</h5> 
                      <p>The tools within imagetools inherit from the purely abstract Tool class. The Factory Method was used, as every tool has a mask which is created by the CreateMask function, however the    way that each tool implements the function has some variation. Therefore, the CreateMask Function is purely virtual and every tool decides how to implement its own mask creater. The exact inheritance structure is shown below:</p>

                      <p>For instructions on how to implement a new tool, follow <a href="#addTool">"Adding Tools"</a>.</p>
                  </div>
                  <br>
                  <div class="subsection" title="FilterDesign">
                      <h5 align="center">Filters Design</h5>
                      <p>Filters follow a similar design as tools, as the Factory Method is used for each filter implementation. The function CalculateFilteredPixel is purely virtual, and each filter subclass must provide   an implementation. One subclass of filters is a new type of filter design, called Convolution filters. </p>
                      <p>The Convolution filters cannot operate in place on the image as they examine neighboring pixels and modify them as the filter is applied. Therefore, they must setup and cleanup filters in a different manner than the superclass filter. The ConvolutionFilter superclass was implemented as the base convolution class, and an implementation for CalculateFilteredPixel was provided. However, each subclass convolution filter creates its own version of a kernel, and the Factory Method was used again for each convolution filter. Each convolution filter inherits from the ConvolutionFilter class, and provides its own implementation of CreateKernel.</p>
                      <p>The inheritence diagram for filters, both simple and convolution filters, are shown below:</p>

                  <div class="subsection" title="CommandLine">
                      <h5 align="center">Command Line Design</h5>
                      <p>The project utilizes the Command Pattern for command line use, where every request from the command line is handled by the class CommandLineProcessor. The CommandLineProcessor class parses the requests from the user and determines whether each request is valid. If every request is valid, the CommandLineProcessor calls the ImageEditorCommands in the order that the requests were received. The ImageEditorCommands class is where every tool, filter, and utility can be called from given the proper request. The structure of the class is shown below:</p>

                        The order of the header and system files is important for the avoidance of hidden dependencies, readability, and standardization.
                    </p>
                    <p>The order is as follows:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Header related to current file. ie: directory/currentclass.h</li>
                        <li>C system files</li>
                        <li>C++ system files</li>
                        <li>Other library header files</li>

                      <p>In order for code to be self documenting, names should accurately reflect what is being named and also be understandable to readers unfamiliar with the project. The subsections below are the conventions most commonly used for this project.</p>

                          Commenting and documentation of code is extremely important. It allows other developers to understand what a piece of code is doing, and how they can properly utilize certain classes and functions to their advantage.
                      </p>
                      <pre> -THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMENTING PRACTICE IS WRITING SELF DOCUMENTING CODE! </pre>
                      <p>
                        Commenting functions and classes is important, however by naming variables and functions properly conveys much more to a developer than having to comment difficult to understand code due to poorly named sections of code. It also makes code more skimmable and easier to understand.
                      </p>
                      <p>There are 3 main ways comments ways to comment:</p>
                      <ol>
                          <li><code>
                              /** Comments inserted here typically describe classes and functions within the header file, and they can span multiple lines. Doxygen is able to capture this style of comment as well. */
                              </code>
                          </li>

                                  // This commenting style is good for single line comments, and is the most common form of commenting. However, this style is not Doxygen recognized.
                              </code>
                          </li>

                      <p>Commenting styles 1 and 2 are Google style compliant, and their use is based on developer preference.

                          <li>
                              End of line comments have two spaces between end of code and comment. 
                              <br>
                              For example: 
                              <pre>
                              end_of_code();  // 2 spaces
                              </pre>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Include a space between the closed parenthesis and the open curly brace
                              <br>
                              For example: 
                              <pre>
                              (...)space{...}
                              </pre>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Parameters that are wrapped require a 4 space indent.
                              <br>
                              For example:<pre>
                              LongNameFunctionWithManyParametersFunction(
                                    type param1,    // 4 spaces
                                    type param2,    // 4 spaces
                                    type param3) {...}
                              </pre>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              Conditionals have one space between <code>if</code> and <code>else if</code>, and the open parenthesis with the condition
                              <br>
                              For example:
                              <pre>
                              if (condition) {...}
                              </pre>
                          </li>
                          <li>
                              When formatting classes in the header files, include one space between the keywords <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, and <code>protected</code>.
                              <br>
                              For example:
                              <pre>

                               private:  // one space indent

                <p>There are two common tasks that are most likely areas of expansion for the projects: additional tools and filters. The subsections below describe the basic procedure to follow to setup your own tools and features.</p>
                  <p>After setting up a new tool or filter, you must remake the project! From the PROJ directory, use the command <code>make clean</code> to clean the project and the command <code>make</code> to rebuild the project.</p>
                <div class="subsection" title="Namespace Use">
                    <h5 id="addFilter" align="center">Adding Filters</h5>
                    <p>There are two types of filters implemented in MIA and Flashphoto. A simple filter is one which can be operated in place and only examines a single pixel. More complex filters require the examination of neighboring pixels, and thus fall under the convolution filter category. Instructions for the implementation of these two filters are described below.</p>
<!--                    <div class="subsection" title="Namespace Use">-->
<!--                      <h5 align="center">Simple Filter</h5>-->
                        <p>
                            Every filter inherits from the imagetools/filter.h file, which describes all basic functions that must be included with a new filter. The base filter class cannot be instantiated, as it is purely virtual. Additionally, convolution filters inherit from from the imagetools/convolution_filter.h file, which inherits from the imagetools/filter.h file.
                        </p>
                        <p> 
                            The one requirement of a new simple filter is that it must include is a CalculateFilteredPixel() method that overrides the purely virtual imagetools/filter.h class. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Convolution filters have a base implementation for the CalculateFilteredPixel() filter method, therefore only require the function CreateKernel() to be overridden by classes which inherit from the convolution filter class.</p>
                        <p>
                            The following are the steps to creating a new filter, and hooking it up to the project to work with the GUI:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Create your new filter inside of the directory <code>imagetools</code>.</li>
                            <li>IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE NEW FILTER WITH THE NAMESPACE image_tools! For example: 
                            <pre>
                            #include "imagetools/filter.h"
                            
                            namespace image_tools {
                            
                            class NewFilter : public Filter {
                            
                            };
                            
                            }
                            </pre>
                            </li>
                            <li>Using proper style as described in the section <a href="#codingStyle">"Coding Style"</a> above, for simple filters include the filter header file as follows: <code>#include "imagetools/filter.h"</code>. For convolution filters, include the convolution header file as follows: <code>#include "imagetools/convolution_filter.h"</code></li>
                            <li>Setup the new class such that the required methods are implemented. Simple filters require CalculateFilteredPixel(), whereas convolution filters require only CreateKernel() as the CalculateFilteredPixel() is handled by the base convolution filter class.  Make sure to still setup the constructor and destructor for the class.</li>
                            <li>Now that the new filter class has been created, it must be setup for use with the GUI. See the section <a href="#guiSetup">"Setting up GUI with New Tool or Filter"</a>.</li>
                            <li>Finally, once the filter has been properly setup with the GUI, the imagetools library must be re-compiled. To do this, move into the PROJ directory and type <code>make clean</code> followed by <code>make imagetools</code>.</li>
                        </ol>
                  <br>

                <div class="subsection" title="Namespace Use">
                    <h5 id="addTool" align="center">Adding Tools</h5>
                    <p>Every tool inherits from the same class: "imagetools/tool.h". Tool is purely virtual, therefore any tool that is created must override the function CreateMask(). The instructions to create a tool are listed as below.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Create your new tool inside of the directory <code>imagetools</code>.</li>
                        <li>Using proper style as described in the section <a href="#codingStyle">"Coding Style"</a>, include the tool header file as follows to the new tool's header file: <code>#include "imagetools/tool.h"</code>.</li>
                        <li>Setup the new class such that the function CreateMask() is implemented as an overridden function from tool. Remember to add constructor and destructor to the new tool.</li>
                        <li>Once the new tool has been created, it must be setup for use with the GUI. See the section <a href="#guiSetup">"Setting up GUI with New Tool or Filter"</a>.</li>
                        <li>After the new tool has been properly setup with the GUI, the imagetools library must be re-compiled. To do this, move into the src directory and type <code>make clean</code> followed by <code>make imagetools</code>.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The new tool or filter must be added to the image_editor files located in the directory imagetools.</p>
                    <p>The key steps to adding the tool or filter to the image_editor class are:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Add the new feature to the includes at the top of the imagetools/image_editor.h file.</li>
                        <li>Add a private data member variable to the image_editor header file.</li>
                        <li>If the new feature is a filter, add an apply function to the class. For example, the quantize filter has a function named 
                            <pre>
                            void ApplyQuantizeFilter(int num_bins);</pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>If the new feature is a tool, add into the GetToolByName() function's conditional statement the name of the new tool and return a pointer to an instance of the tool.
                        For example:
                            <pre> 
                            } else if (name == t_new_.name()) {
                              return &t_new_;
                            }
                            </pre>
                        </li>
                        <li>Now that the new feature has been added to the image_editor, the last step requires the feature to be hooked up to the GUI for the desired project. The GUI for Flashphoto is located in <code>flashphoto/flashphoto_app.cc</code> and for MIA the GUI is located in <code>mia/mia_app.cc</code></li>
